# Gee-You-Eye Or is it Gooey?

I made this repo to place some of the Graphical User Interface programs I implement in Python(as of now) as I go through my last two years of uni. Most will be very simple and basic programs here and there. 

If I take on a big one it will be in its own repo that way I document my progress with it properly. For now, here are some very easy ones from this week's first class covering GUI concepts using tkinter (I know, I know. There are other module options for GUI. I will learn the others as I go)
